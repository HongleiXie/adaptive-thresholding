# adaptive thresholding
Little theoretical work or numerical work has been done for choice between
different thresholding functions in the context of estimation of covariance matrix under high dimensional setting. 
Based on the adaptive thresholding estimation method, I will fill in the gap, 
comparing performance of different thresholding functions under adaptive estimation framework. 
Please see the [paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.2237.pdf) for details of the procedures.
